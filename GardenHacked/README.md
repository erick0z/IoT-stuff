# Garden Hacked Project

Platform:

Intel XDK IoT, Intel edison.


The code allow to monitor the status of a plant through three main sensors; The main sensor is for humidity, the others are for light exposition and temperature. We also have an automated system for water suply with a tiny water pump, it is triggered when critical humidity levels are given.

AT&T M2X API

We use this API to store the data we obtain from the sensors in the cloud for further usage.
